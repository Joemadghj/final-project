                    <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">Wildfires</h1><br>
                    <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in the wildland vegetation, often in rural areas. Wildfires can burn in forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems, and have been doing so for hundreds of millions of years. They
                        are not limited to a particular continent or environment. Wildfires can burn in vegetation located both in and above the soil. Ground fires typically ignite in soil thick with organic matter that can feed the flames, like plant
                        roots. Ground fires can smolder for a long time—even an entire season—until conditions are right for them to grow to a surface or crown fire. Surface fires, on the other hand, burn in dead or dry vegetation that is lying or growing
                        just above the ground. Parched grass or fallen leaves often fuel surface fires. Crown fires burn in the leaves and canopies of trees and shrubs. Some regions, like the mixed conifer forests of California’s Sierra Nevada mountain
                        range, can be affected by different types of wildfires. Sierra Nevada forest fires often include both crown and surface spots. Wildfires can start with a natural occurrence—such as a lightning strike—or a human-made spark. However,
                        it is often the weather conditions that determine how much a wildfire grows. Wind, high temperatures, and little rainfall can all leave trees, shrubs, fallen leaves, and limbs dried out and primed to fuel a fire. Topography plays
                        a big part too: flames burn uphill faster than they burn downhill. Wildfires that burn near communities can become dangerous and even deadly if they grow out of control. For example, the 2018 Camp Fire in Butte County, California
                        destroyed almost the entire town of Paradise; in total, 86 people died. Still, wildfires are essential to the continued survival of some plant species. For example, some tree cones need to be heated before they open and release
                        their seeds; chaparral plants, which include manzanita, chamise (Adenostoma fasciculatum), and scrub oak (Quercus berberidifolia), require fire before seeds will germinate. The leaves of these plants include a flammable resin that
                        feeds fire, helping the plants to propagate. Plants such as these depend on wildfires in order to pass through a regular life cycle. Some plants require fire every few years, while others require fire just a few times a century
                        for the species to continue. Wildfires also help keep ecosystems healthy. They can kill insects and diseases that harm trees. By clearing scrub and underbrush, fires can make way for new grasses, herbs, and shrubs that provide
                        food and habitat for animals and birds. At a low intensity, flames can clean up debris and underbrush on the forest floor, add nutrients to the soil, and open up space to let sunlight through to the ground. That sunlight can nourish
                        smaller plants and give larger trees room to grow and flourish. While many plants and animals need and benefit from wildfires, climate change has left some ecosystems more susceptible to flames, especially in the southwest United
                        States. Warmer temperatures have intensified drought and dried out forests. The historic practice of putting out all fires also has caused an unnatural buildup of shrubs and debris, which can fuel larger and more intense blazes.

                        An earthquake is an intense shaking of Earth's surface. The shaking is caused by movements in Earth's outermost layer and an earthquake is the sudden movement of Earth's crust. Earthquakes occur along fault lines, cracks in Earth's crust where tectonic
                        plates meet. They occur where plates are subducting, spreading, slipping, or colliding. As the plates grind together, they get stuck and pressure builds up.</p><br>

                            <h1 id="sec-3" class="titlesss">Droughts</h1> <br>
                            <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">A drought is a period of time when an area or region experiences below-normal precipitation. The lack of adequate precipitation, either rain or snow, can cause reduced soil moisture or groundwater, diminished stream flow, crop
                                damage, and a general water shortage. Droughts are the second-most costly weather events after hurricanes. Unlike with sudden weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and thunderstorms, it is often difficult to pinpoint
                                when a drought has started or when it has ended. The initial effects of a drought may be difficult to identify right away, so it may take weeks or months to determine that a drought has started. The end of a drought is
                                hard to identify for the same reason. A drought may last for weeks, months, or even years. Sometimes, drought conditions can exist for a decade or more in a region. The longer a drought lasts, the greater the harmful effects
                                it has on people. Droughts affect people in a several ways. Access to clean drinking water is essential for all life, and sources of water may dwindle during a drought. Without the presence of water, people must bring in
                                enough water from elsewhere to survive. Water is also needed for crops to grow. When not enough precipitation falls to naturally water crops, they must be watered by irrigation. Irrigation is possible only when there is
                                enough water in nearby rivers, lakes, or streams, or from groundwater. During a drought, these water sources are diminished and may even dry up, preventing crops from being irrigated and causing them to die off. One person
                                studying these problems is Alexandra Cousteau, a National Geographic Emerging Explorer whose latest initiative is Blue Legacy. She started Blue Legacy to raise awareness that we live on a water planet and must take care
                                of it. Cousteau, the granddaughter of the famed ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau, believes that water will be a crucial issue in this century. She predicts that water problems such as drought, storms, floods, and degraded
                                water quality will create “water refugees:” people migrating in search of water. Cousteau stresses that we must do all we can to protect Earth’s valuable freshwater resources.</p><br>

                       >
                      <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Droughts are caused by low precipitation over an extended period of time. Atmospheric conditions such as climate change, ocean temperatures, changes in the jet stream, and changes in the local landscape are all factors that contribute to drought.</p><br>
                      <h1 id="sec-3" class="titlesss">How are businesses affected by Droughts and what should we do in response?</h1><br>
                      <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Businesses are sensitive to drought, especially when key components of their operations are dependent upon water at a specific quality and time. However, some of the major water-related risks that businesses face are made worse by poor functioning water supply systems. This is especially true in smaller municipalities. Although businesses (especially large businesses) have vocalised their concerns regarding water, limited active measures have been put in place to mitigate these risks.

                        Businesses sit at the interface of the water value chain and a particular products’ supply chain. Depending on where they sit, their risks are distinct. Therefore, it is not only about the water supply to a single company, but also the water supply to their labour, customers and community. Water and business is more than purely water for inputs. This is why businesses need to be good water stewards, and consider their role in water outside the factory fence.
                        
                        “Businesses”, both large and small, are difficult to segregate into a specific sector. We have considered the business sector as all businesses that are using water within a small city or town.
                        
                        Therefore their usage is considered urban in nature. As a result of the drought, businesses in towns or cities do not have secure access to water to carry out their operations.
                        
                        The national development plan articulates the important role of small business and co-operatives in achieving inclusive economic growth, and that these small enterprises are key to achieving the plan’s job creation target for 2030. In 2010, South Africa had nearly six-million small companies; over 60% of the owners had left school before matric, while 58% of small business owners were women. Most small businesses are informal SMMEs.
                        
                        The impact of drought on the sector is dependent on the importance of water for various types of small business. For small businesses that are particularly dependent on water for operations, water restrictions or supply interruptions impact on revenue and income and the business becomes threatened.
                        
                        The businesses most affected by droughts include food, hairdressers, launderettes, and car washes.
                        
                        In the town of Thaba Nchu (where most small companies surveyed were in the informal sector, and had a turnover of less than R50,000 per annum) the most vulnerable were butcheries which use a lot of water for production, and grocers that use water for keeping vegetables fresh. The drought negatively impacted on them; for instance, vegetables withered due to lack of water and could not be sold. Some 87% of businesses reported losing over half their revenue due to the drought. One grocer stated that the impact of the drought was mainly experienced in the ablution facilities where there was inadequate water for staff and product hygiene. The facility could only deliver poor service and this negatively affected customers and staff. As a short-term response, the grocer bought a 2,000 litre JoJo tank.
                        
                        One taxi operator stated that the impact of the drought was mostly felt by his customers. Since they did not have money to afford taxi fares, there were very few customers asking for a ride (business was very poor). The lack of water also had an impact on sanitation: it was not possible to wash his taxi, which negatively impacted on custom.
                        
                        A small-scale fashion designer stated that a consistent water supply was essential for ironing and washing. Since water was in short supply, they had to fetch it from a stand pipe tap; only a five-minute walk away but the queue at the stand pipe took 30 minutes, wasting business time. The fetched water was insufficient for bathing, drinking, cleaning, cooking for the employees – activities they needed to do in the course of the day. Thus, they had to make trade-offs: employees had to stop bathing at work, with the saved water used for the business.
                        
                        The impact of the recent drought on large businesses in South Africa has also been severe. The recent CDP report on water said that 83% of respondents reported “that their direct operations are exposed to water-related risks, the highest of any sample in the world, with more than half of these risks expected to manifest within the next three years and with two-thirds of those risks having a financial impact of medium to high”. Around 70% of respondents said they had already had their business damaged by water risks in 2015 .
                        
                        We need to promote good water stewardship among the businesses of South Africa. This may include helping businesses consider their role in the water system beyond their own operational needs.
                        
                        Each company represents a number of employees, customers and a community. All of these people require secure access to water for their business to thrive. Therefore, business should consider their role in supporting good water management as a long-term strategic investment into their business. No single business can do this alone. Working together is of paramount importance.
                        
                        We need to better understand our businesses and the risks that they are facing. There are initiatives under way, such as the CDP Water questionnaire, but these are focussed on large businesses. The Ministry of Small Business Development needs an analysis of the water-related risks to small businesses as a core component of their activities to ensure that small business does not suffer as a result of drought when mitigating activities could be put in place beforehand.
                        
                        We need to interrogate the response of government to businesses that increase their water efficiency. This is because, during times of drought, when a blanket reduction of water usage is effected, those that are the most efficient suffer the most. This is a perverse outcome which does not support the right behaviour.
                        
                        We need to consider how to reward good actions that companies undertake before a drought comes into effect.

                        <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">2021 Earthquakes: On February 13 a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of Japan’s Fukushima Prefecture near the area of the devastating 2011 quake. According to Aon as many as 4,700 residential structures were damaged or destroyed. Total economic losses were expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars.

                          2020 Earthquakes: Croatia experienced the strongest earthquake in 140 years on December 29, a 6.4 magnitude quake 50 km southeast of the capital, Zagreb. The Economic Ministry of Croatia estimated that insured losses would be about $63.5 million, a tiny fraction of the $13.7 billion in total losses. In March, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.3 struck the region north of Zagreb, causing property losses of $1.8 billion according to Munich Re.
                          
                          In the United States, on January 7, a 6.5-magnitude earthquake struck southwest Puerto Rico, which lies in a tectonically active region. The island had not had a quake of this level since 1918. The 2020 quake caused widespread damage to infrastructure in a region that is still recovering from the effects of 2017’s Hurricane Maria.
                          
                          2019 Earthquakes: In the United States, the sparsely populated Ridgecrest City section of California was struck by a pair of significant earthquakes in 2019. On July 4 a 6.4-magnitude “foreshock” earthquake hit the area, followed by a stronger 7.1-magnitude quake the following day, along with a number of aftershocks. The 7.1 quake was the largest to hit the state in 20 years. According to Karen Clark and Co., insured losses from the quakes are estimated to total less than $40 million.
                          
                          2018 Earthquakes: On September 5 an earthquake struck Hokkaido, Japan which left dozens dead and caused more than $1.7 billion in damage, according to Aon. On June 17 another strong earthquake impacted Osaka Japan, resulting in insured losses of at least $935 million.
                          
                          In the United States, a magnitude 7.0 tremor struck near Anchorage, Alaska on November 30. losses totaled more than $150 million.
                          
                          2011 Earthquakes: On March 11, 2011 a devastating tsunami hit the coast of northeast Japan, triggered by a powerful earthquake approximately 80 miles offshore. The quake and tsunami caused $40 billion in insured damages when it occurred ($46 billion in 2020 dollars), according to Munich Re. Also, in February 2011 a powerful earthquake struck Christchurch, New Zealand, resulting in $16.5 billion in insured damages when it occurred ($19 billion in 2020 dollars) . The Japan and New Zealand quakes are among the 10 costliest world earthquakes and tsunamis, based on insured damages, according to Munich Re (see table).
                          
                          Tsunamis may travel thousands of kilometers and reach speeds of up to 800 km/h. They can have disastrous effects on the town once they reach the coast. Several crests can appear at periods of 10 to 45 minutes, wreaking havoc for several hours.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">A volcano is a crack or opening in the earth's surface through which magma (hot liquid or semi-liquid rock), volcanic ash, and gases can escape. They are most commonly seen where tectonic plates collide or divide, but volcanic hotspots can also cause them to form in the midst of plates. A volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano releases lava and gas, sometimes explosively. A 'glowing avalanche,' which occurs when newly erupted lava slides down the flanks of a volcano, is the most deadly sort of eruption. They have the ability to travel swiftly and reach temperatures of up to 1,200°F. Ash fall and lahars are two other dangers (mud or debris flows). Volcanoes frequently result in human dislocation and food scarcity.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">How Volcanoes Erupt?</h1><br>

              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">All volcanoes share the same basic features. The magma collects in magma chambers that can be 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. As the rock heats, it expands, which creates even more pressure. As a result, the magma seeks a way out pushing toward the surface, the magma seeping through cracks in the Earth’s crust called vents. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface; when it comes out, we call it an eruption. The word eruption is used in other contexts, as well. An eruption can be an outburst or explosion, a violent and sudden occurrence, like when a crowd erupts in anger. But an eruption can also be a spreading of something like a rash on your skin, gradual and relatively calm. These two definitions are similar to the two kinds of eruptions that we see in volcanoes.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-1" class="titlesss">how can a Volcanic Eruption affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">Volcanic ash falls, like other natural disasters, are unplanned events that can disrupt businesses. Ashfall can cause physical damage to buildings, equipment, computers, machinery, vehicles, inventory, and supplies, and can cause a temporary shutdown of business operations (hours to days or longer). Furthermore, a series of explosive eruptions over a period of weeks to months can result in multiple ashfalls, necessitating costly cleanup operations after each one. One of the most important steps to take to mitigate the potential effects of ash and improve the response and recovery of a business to ashfall is to create a general plan for dealing with emergencies and a specific plan for ashfall. Resources for developing emergency and contingency plans are available elsewhere.

                Businesses and organisations should consider their vulnerability to volcanic ash falls during non-eruptive periods. Mitigation strategies can be developed after the vulnerability has been assessed. (Johnston and Becker, 2001) There are three types of approaches that can be used:
                <br>Policy and management measures that reduce the likelihood of damage or failure of equipment from volcanic ash.
                Engineering design measures that reduce vulnerability to ash.
                Preparedness and response planning to deal with ashfall and cleanup activities.

              <p id="sec-1" class="children-info">More than 80% of the earth's surface is made up of volcanic rock. Numerous volcanic explosions shaped the sea floor and some mountains. The earth's atmosphere was produced by gaseous eruptions from volcanoes.
                There are over 500 active volcanoes scattered around the world mostly found near the pacific ocean.
                Every year, approximately 50-70 volcanoes erupt on average. Some of them explode more than once, while others only erupt once. The average number of separate eruptions every year is somewhere between 60 and 80.
                A graph that shows how many volcanoes erupt per year from 1790 to 1990. A dramatic increase in the number of eruptions can be seen through the years.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">An earthquake (also called a quake, tremor, or temblor) is the shaking of the Earth's surface caused by a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere, which results in seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in size from those that are too little to be felt to those that are powerful enough to throw things and people into the air and destroy entire towns. The number, nature, and size of earthquakes experienced in a given area is referred to as seismicity, or seismic activity. Non-earthquake seismic rumbling is also referred to as tremor.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2" class="children-info">What causes earthquakes and where do they happen?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-2" class="children-info">how do Earthquakes affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info"><br>For starters, earthquakes can activate sprinkler systems and breakwater lines, both of which can cause water to cascade onto important business files.

                Gas lines can also be damaged by earthquakes. Leaking gas can explode into a fire with a single spark, destroying irreplaceable documents and other business assets. Smoke can also harm items that haven't been affected by the flames.
                
                Furthermore, seismic activity has the potential to loosen unstable soil, resulting in mudslides and flash floods. Even businesses located far from the epicentre of a quake may be affected.
                
                Even if a business is left with mountains of flood-damaged books and documents as a result of an earthquake, document scanning services can repair damaged papers using desiccant air drying and vacuum freeze-drying. Even so, creating a workaround for flood-damaged documents and books before a disaster is less expensive.

              <p id="sec-2" class="children-info">Earthquakes usually occur on the edges of large sections of the Earth's crust called tectonic plates.
                Each year, there are an estimated 500,000 earthquakes that can be detected around the world. There are 100,000 of them, and 100 of them inflict damage.
                Earthquakes usually happen around the west side of the earth in the bottom part of North America and the top part of South America. Earthquakes also commonly occur in Asia around Indonesia, Japan, and Pakistan.</strong></p><br>

              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">A tropical cyclone is a low-pressure weather system that rotates around the earth and has structured thunderstorms but no fronts (a boundary separating two air masses of different densities). Tropical depressions are tropical cyclones with maximum sustained surface winds of less than 39 miles per hour (mph). Tropical storms are defined as storms having maximum sustained winds of 39 mph or above.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Tropical cyclones are created from warm, moist air above the ocean waters near the equator. The rising warm air creates an area of lower air pressure and air from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes into this lower pressure area.</p><br>

              <p id="sec-3" class="children-info">Hurricanes that cause significant damage may force a business to close for days or even weeks while repairs are made, resulting in a revenue loss that may be difficult to recover from. Few businesses can afford to close their doors for an extended period of time and expect to stay in business.

                How Some Businesses May Benefit
                
                While some businesses, particularly those in the service industry, may benefit from a hurricane, for the most part, these storms only cause business interruptions that can last for months.
                
                In many cases, it is the profit boost that these industries provide that attracts an entrepreneur to a specific location. If you're willing to put up with the inconveniences of hurricanes and tropical storms, such a move could pay off handsomely. Many of these businesses in hurricane-prone areas rely on the five-and-a-half-month hurricane season between June and November to generate the majority of their annual revenue.

                In the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, an average of ten tropical storms form each year. Many of these are still floating in the ocean. Each year, six of these storms develop into hurricanes.
                Hurricanes happen consistently per year with minor rising and falling in number of occurrences.

              <h1 id="sec-4" class="titlesss">Tsunamis</h1>
              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a sequence of extraordinarily long waves created by a huge and sudden shift in the ocean floor, which is usually caused by an earthquake beneath or near the ocean floor. This force generates waves that travel in all directions away from their source, spanning entire ocean basins in the process. Tsunamis travel through the entire water column, from the ocean floor to the ocean surface, unlike wind-driven waves, which only travel through the highest layer of the.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-4" class="titlesss">How does a Tsunami occur?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">A tsunami is a series of long, high sea waves caused by a disturbance in the water. This disturbance can come about in many ways such as an earthquake, landslide, volcanic eruption, or meteorite. The most common causes are volcanic or earthquake activity, and the disturbance itself causes abrupt movement of the water column.Tsunamis are different to the ordinary undersea currents, as these are caused by the gravitational pull of the Moon and Sun, resulting in tides, while some sea waves are caused by the wind. Moreover, tsunamis do not take after normal waves as they have a much longer wavelength (distance between successive peaks).

              <h1 id="sec-4" class="titlesss">how can Tsunamis affect business?</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">Many businesses will be unable to trade immediately after a tsunami disaster due to the destruction of their premises, stock, machinery, facilities, transportation networks, supplies, and staff. All sectors of the business community are likely to be impacted, albeit to varying degrees (see Table 2). Loss of agricultural production (due to a variety of factors such as crop loss, soil contamination, destruction of market and distribution networks, and loss of livestock populations) can have significant economic consequences, particularly for developing countries and small island states that rely heavily on agriculture.</p><br>
              <h1 id="sec-4" class="titlesss">Statistics:</h1><br>
              <p id="sec-4" class="children-info">Tsunamis killed more than 250 000 people worldwide between 1998 and 2017, including more than 227 000 people in the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.

                Tsunamis can travel thousands of kilometers and reach speeds of up to 800 km/h. They can have disastrous effects on the town once they reach the coast.
                Most tsunamis usually happen around the pacific ocean and nearby countries so over 700 million people live in low-lying coastal regions that are vulnerable to extreme sea-level disasters such as tsunamis.
                
                Tsunamis may travel thousands of kilometers and reach speeds of up to 800 km/h. They can have disastrous effects on the town once they reach the coast. Several crests can appear at periods of 10 to 45 minutes, wreaking havoc for several hours.</p><br>

            <h1>Volcanic Eruptions</h1>
            <p><h3>A volcano is a crack or opening in the earth's surface through which magma (hot liquid or semi-liquid rock), volcanic ash, and gases can escape. They are most commonly seen where tectonic plates collide or divide, but volcanic hotspots can also cause them to form in the midst of plates. A volcanic eruption occurs when a volcano releases lava and gas, sometimes explosively. A 'glowing avalanche,' which occurs when newly erupted lava slides down the flanks of a volcano, is the most deadly sort of eruption. They have the ability to travel swiftly and reach temperatures of up to 1,200°F. Ash fall and lahars are two other dangers (mud or debris flows). Volcanoes frequently result in human dislocation and food scarcity.</h3>
